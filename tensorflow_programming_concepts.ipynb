    "# TensorFlow Programming Concepts\n",

    "__Learning Objective:__\n",
    "* Learn the basics of the TensorFlow programming model, focusing on the following concepts:\n",
    "    * tensors\n",
    "    * operations\n",
    "    * graphs\n",
    "    * sessions\n",
    "* Build a simple TensorFlow program that creates a default graph, and a session that runs the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Concepts\n",
    "TensorFlow gets its name from __tensors__, which are arrays of arbitrary dimensionality. Using TensorFlow, you can manipulate tensors with a very hihg number of dimensions. \n",
    "* A __scalar__ is a 0-d array (a 0th-order tensor). For example, \"Howdy\" or 5\n",
    "* A __vector__ is a 1-d array (a 1st-order tensor). For E.g., [2,3,4] or [5]\n",
    "* A __matrix__ is a 2-d array (a 2nd-order tensor). For E.g., [[2,3,4], [-2,1,5]]\n",
    "TensorFlow __operations__ create, destroy, and manipulate tensor. Most lines of code in typical TensorFlow are operations.\n",
    "A TensorFlow __graph__ (also known as a __computational graph__ or __dataflow graph__) a graph data structure. The ouput tensor of one operation often becomes the input tensor to a subsequent operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors can be stored in the graph as __constants__ or __variables__. Constants hold tensors whose values can't change, \n",
    "\n",
    "To define a constant, use the tf.constant operator and pass in its value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    " x = tf.constant(5.2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Similarly, you can create a variable like\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y = tf.Variable([5])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Graphs must run within a TensorFlow __session__, which holds the state for the graph(s) it runs:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with tf.Session() as sess:\n",
    "    initialization = tf.global_variables_initializer()\n",
    "    print y.eval()\n",
    "```\n",
